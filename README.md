# content-type-selector

`<content-type-selector>` is an element that provides an UI for selecting common
content type values.

The element do not renders a value that is not defined on the list.
Instead it shows the default label.

If the content type is more complex, mening has additional information like
`multipart/form-data; boundary=something` then, in this case` only the
`multipart/form-data` is taken into the account when computing selected item.

The element fires the `content-type-changed` custom event when the user change
the value in the drop down container. It is not fired when the change has not
beem cause by the user.

### Example
```
<content-type-selector></content-type-selector>
```

The list of content type values can be extended by setting child `<paper-item>`
elements with the `data-type` attribute set to content type value.

### Example
```
<content-type-selector>
  <paper-item data-type="application/zip">Zip file</paper-item>
  <paper-item data-type="application/7z">7-zip file</paper-item>
</content-type-selector>
```

### Listening for content type change event

By default the element listens for the `content-type-changed` custom event on
global `window` object. This can be controlled by setting the `eventsTarget`
property to an element that will be used as an event listeners target.
This way the application can scope events accepted by this element.

Once the `content-type-changed` custom event it changes value of current
content type on this element unless the event has been canceled.
